            <p>At Jake & Amy’s Sub Shop, we believe great sandwiches bring people together. What started as a shared dream between two
            sandwich-loving best friends (yes, Jake <em>and</em> Amy!) quickly turned into a neighborhood staple for bold, fresh, and toasty
            subs made with heart.
            <br><br>
            From our signature Brooklyn Italian to Amy’s crisp Garden Delight, every sub is crafted with premium ingredients and a
            passion for flavor. Whether you're in for a quick lunch, a family meal, or a late-night snack, you’re part of the Jake &
            Amy’s family.
            <br><br>
            We keep things real, fresh, and fun — just like our sandwiches.
            <br>
            <strong>Fresh. Toasted. Legendary. That’s our promise.</strong>
            <br><br>
